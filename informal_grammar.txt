Source grammar:
--------------------------

1. All explicit declarations are outside the function
   and refer to persistent, stateful variables.
2. All local variables are manipulated only through
   packet attributes, which are rewritten into local variables anyway.
   It's our very own form of highly simplified scalar replacement.
3. Only assignments, conditional operators, and other binary operators.
4. Only if/else-if control flow.
5. No arrays, heaps, switch cases, goto, setjmp, function calls.
6. No spurious semicolons.

Target grammar:
----------------------------
1. Canonicalized version of source.
