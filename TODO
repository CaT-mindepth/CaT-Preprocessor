 - handling of conditionals during synthesis. If a component (i.e. a group of statements)
   involves a conditional, then we must use a stateful grammar to synthesize it.
 - packing more into stateful components in the SCC-graph. 
    * this involves creating a struct / class called "Component" that can distinguish
    itself from a stateful one or a stateless one.
